SHORT DESCRIPTION
    This help explain general considerations for this module and organizations for developer new cmdlets in this modules or fix existent.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	CustomMSSQL modules is developed by Rodrigo Ribeiro Gomes (www.thesqltimes.com)
	Its is free for distribute and modify. The sale is not allowed.

	CustomMSSQL provides new cmdlets for manage and query SQL Server using powershell.
	Its is based on dayly based DBA advanced tasks.
	
	You must use Get-Command -Module CustomMSSQL command for view all cmdlets exported.
	Use Get-Help CmdLet name for more details.

	In some scenarios, you must want use a cmdlet directly instead of importing the module.
	Fot this, CustomMSSQL provide standalone implementation of some cmdlets of module. It will are on "<root>\standalone" folder.
	Because some cmdlets, like Copy-SQLDataase depends on some modules facilities, some implementations cannot be avalaible at given time.
	And some implementantions in standalone, can be without some facilities provided by CustomMSSQL structure, like logging.
	Standalone is useful, for example, when you need use CustomMSSQL via remote share and time spend importing module is too long.
	You can access directly standalone version of cmdlet to improve perfomance.
	Check standlone documentantion for more details!

	
	MOTIVATION
		CustomMSSQL was developed for bypass default problems in cmdlets provided by Microsoft sqlps module.
		Its use pure powershell (and .NET integration) for making the thinkgs more easy.
	 
	
	MODULE PROGRAMMER REFERENCE

		FILE STRUCTURE

			The modules is organized in following files:
			
				cmdlets.ps1
					Are files with cmdlets code. Its must have functions definitions in format Noun-Verb that will be exported.
				aux.ps1
					Are helper functions. It must provide functions that will not be exported. 
					The functions cannot have a Noun-Verb because it will be exported.
					If your intention isnt not export the function, then dont use *-* in name.
					
			By default, module will search this files on root directory.
			You can change this behavior at export time by using parameters CmdLetsDir and AuxDir
			
		
		DEFAULT FUNCTIONS
		
			Some default functions are provide for standard use.
			This functions are defined as aux.ps1 files.
			
				GetLogObject (Log.aux.ps1)			
					Provides standard way to logging.
					Check details for more information.
					This functions return a object that you can use for logging.
